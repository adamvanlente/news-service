## news-service
a node app that accepts a list of (RSS) news sources and offers endpoints for making use of them.

### usage

###### cron job

The news service offers an endpoint that can be run like a cron job.  Instead of running the script as a cron, you can reach the endpoint
	
	/cron

and run as often as you like.  When this url is curled, it dumps any (new) new stories into the database.

#### endpoints

The app has two endpoints baked in currently.

###### all news stories

	// Paginated news stories, newest to oldest.
	/api/v1/news/{STARTING_INDEX}
	
	// Example query
	/api/v1/news/40
	
	// Example result.  Does not actually contain ellipses as picture
	// below - just trying to keep the README neat.  Results are
	// paginated with 20 items per page.
	"count": 20,
	"results": [
		{
			"itemId": "Blake Shelton Welcomes New Coaches...",
			"title": "Blake Shelton Welcomes New Coaches...",
			"content": "Blake Shelton ...",

			"type": "news",
			"_id": "someid",
			"votes": "0"
		},... // 19 more results
	"next_page": "/api/v1/news/60" }]

###### search news stories

	/api/v1/news/search/{SEARCH_TERM}
